# Aesthetic Typing

In  this project, I use Svelte and Vite to create a minimalistic typing test with basic functionality. Although the results of the project look simple, managing complexity for many edge cases can get touch when using vanilla Javascript. To remedy this, using a fast, simple framework like Svelte simplifies and makes the code more readable. Feel free to fork this repo to extent the basic functionality!
